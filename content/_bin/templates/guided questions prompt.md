## Guided Questions

These Guided Questions will help you explore those unconscious beliefs, patterns, and self-reflection, and encourage acceptance. This can be hard and maybe uncomfortable but it is outside of comfort where we truly grow.

### How do I respond internally when I perceive injustice, and what does this reveal about my core values?

### In what ways do I distract myself from facing my inner thoughts, and what might I be avoiding?

### What patterns do I notice in the way I end or maintain relationships, and what can they teach me about my attachment style?
